# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization

## Introduction
This repository contains projects and work from my Accenture virtual internship in data analytics and visualization. The internship involved advising a hypothetical social media client by cleaning, modeling, and analyzing datasets to uncover insights into content trends, which informed strategic decisions.

## Skills
Throughout the internship, I developed and utilized the following skills:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Modeling
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- PowerPoint Presentation
- Communication and Presentation Skills

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- datasets: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- presentations: Contains PowerPoint presentations summarizing the findings.
- reports: Contains detailed reports and documentation.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are provided in the datasets folder. Each dataset is documented with its source, structure, and purpose in the analysis.

## Analysis
The analysis performed during the internship includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values, correcting errors, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Data Model**: Combining three separate datasets into a single cohesive dataset for analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to visualize data trends and insights.

## Results
The key findings and recommendations from the analysis are summarized in the reports folder. The findings are also presented in the PowerPoint presentations in the presentations folder.

## How to Use
To explore the analysis and results, follow these steps:
1. Explore the datasets in the datasets folder.
2. Review the findings in the reports folder.
3. View the PowerPoint presentations in the presentations folder.
